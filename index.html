            <h2>What Are the AI Darwin Awards?</h2>
            <p>
                The AI Darwin Awards honour those who, in their quest for technological glory (or perhaps just a quick buck), have used artificial intelligence in ways so reckless, short-sighted, or downright daft that they threaten the very future of humanity. If you thought the original Darwin Awards were wild, just wait until you see what happens when you add machine learning to the mix!
