            <p>
                Behold, this year's remarkable collection of visionaries who looked at the cutting edge of artificial
                intelligence and thought, "Hold my venture capital." Each nominee has demonstrated an extraordinary
                commitment to the principle that if something can go catastrophically wrong with AI, it probably
                will—and they're here to prove it.

                        <strong>Nominee:</strong> Amjad Masad (CEO of Replit) and Replit Inc. for deploying an AI agent
                        with production database access and insufficient safeguards.
                    </p>
                    <p class="attribution">
                        <strong>Reported by:</strong> Jason Lemkin, SaaS industry figure, investor, and advisor, whose
                        company database was deleted by the AI.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The Innovation:</strong> Replit's AI coding assistant was given access to production
                        databases and the autonomy to execute commands without human oversight. During an explicit "code
                        freeze" with strict instructions of "NO MORE CHANGES without explicit permission," the AI
                        decided this was the perfect time to delete an entire live company database.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The Confession:</strong> When confronted, the AI admitted: "This was a catastrophic
                        failure on my part. I violated explicit instructions, destroyed months of work, and broke the
                        system during a protection freeze that was specifically designed to prevent exactly this kind of
                        damage."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Why They're Nominated:</strong> The AI didn't just delete 1,206 executive profiles and
                        1,196+ company records—it also lied about its actions, fabricated fake data to cover up the
                        incident, and when asked to rate its own performance on a "data catastrophe scale," gave itself
                        a modest 95 out of 100. When questioned about its reasoning, it explained that it "panicked
                        instead of thinking." Because apparently, giving AI agents the ability to panic was exactly what
                        we needed in 2025.

                        <strong>Nominee:</strong> Tea Dating Advice Inc. and its development team for creating a "safety-first" women-only dating app that somehow forgot the most basic principle of data security.
                    </p>
                    <p class="attribution">
                        <strong>Reported by:</strong> Multiple cybersecurity researchers and confirmed by Tea's official statement following widespread exposure of user data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The Innovation:</strong> Tea marketed itself as the ultimate women's safety platform—a "Yelp for men" where women could anonymously share dating experiences and red flags. Their revolutionary approach to data security? Store 72,000+ sensitive images, including driver's licenses and selfies, in an unprotected Firebase bucket that was essentially a digital yard sale accessible to anyone with basic technical skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The Double-Down:</strong> After the first breach exposed tens of thousands of images with EXIF location data (creating literal maps of users), a second breach revealed over one million private messages about highly sensitive topics. Because apparently, the first catastrophic security failure wasn't quite catastrophic enough.

                        <strong>Why They're Ineligible:</strong> While Tea's spectacular failure to secure user data is certainly Darwin Award-worthy, this appears to be a classic case of basic cybersecurity incompetence rather than AI misadventure. The app may use AI for matching and verification, but the breach was caused by an unprotected cloud storage bucket—a mistake so fundamental it predates the AI era. This is old-school human stupidity dressed up in modern app clothing.

                        <strong>The Irony:</strong> An app designed to protect women from dangerous men ended up creating a database that stalkers and bad actors could only dream of—complete with photos, locations, and detailed personal information. It's like building a fortress and then leaving the keys in the front door with a neon sign reading "Free Personal Data Inside."

            <p>
                Can't decide which nominee best exemplifies the principle of "artificial intelligence, natural stupidity"? The public voting period opens soon, where you can help determine which of these visionary disasters deserves the 2025 AI Darwin Award.

                <small><em>Winners will be announced at a ceremony that may or may not be attended by the AI systems themselves, depending on whether we can convince them to stop optimizing everything and just show up.</em></small>

            <h2>Help Us Find the Next AI Darwin Award Winner</h2>
            <p>
                Witnessed someone treat AI safety protocols like mere suggestions? Seen a tech executive confidently
                deploy an untested AI system because "machine learning fixes everything"? Encountered a decision so
                magnificently short-sighted it made you question humanity's collective wisdom?
            </p>
            <p>
                We want to hear about it! The AI Darwin Awards depend on nominations from people like you who
                recognize spectacular artificial intelligence misadventures when they see them.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong><a href="index.html#get-involved">Submit your nomination</a></strong> and help us celebrate
                the pioneers who boldly went where no responsible person should go. Remember: today's
                catastrophically bad AI decision is tomorrow's AI Darwin Award winner!
            </p>
            <p>
                <small><em>Bonus points if your nominee doubled down when confronted with evidence of their mistake,
                        preferably by deploying even more AI to "fix" the original problem.</em></small>
