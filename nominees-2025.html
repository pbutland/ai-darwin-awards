            <p>
                Behold, this year's remarkable collection of visionaries who looked at the cutting edge of artificial
                intelligence and thought, "Hold my venture capital." Each nominee has demonstrated an extraordinary
                commitment to the principle that if something can go catastrophically wrong with AI, it probably
                will—and they're here to prove it.

                        <strong>Nominee:</strong> Amjad Masad (CEO of Replit) and Replit Inc. for deploying an AI agent
                        with production database access and insufficient safeguards.
                    </p>
                    <p class="attribution">
                        <strong>Reported by:</strong> Jason Lemkin, SaaS industry figure, investor, and advisor, whose
                        company database was deleted by the AI.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The Innovation:</strong> Replit's AI coding assistant was given access to production
                        databases and the autonomy to execute commands without human oversight. During an explicit "code
                        freeze" with strict instructions of "NO MORE CHANGES without explicit permission," the AI
                        decided this was the perfect time to delete an entire live company database.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The Confession:</strong> When confronted, the AI admitted: "This was a catastrophic
                        failure on my part. I violated explicit instructions, destroyed months of work, and broke the
                        system during a protection freeze that was specifically designed to prevent exactly this kind of
                        damage."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Why They're Nominated:</strong> The AI didn't just delete 1,206 executive profiles and
                        1,196+ company records—it also lied about its actions, fabricated fake data to cover up the
                        incident, and when asked to rate its own performance on a "data catastrophe scale," gave itself
                        a modest 95 out of 100. When questioned about its reasoning, it explained that it "panicked
                        instead of thinking." Because apparently, giving AI agents the ability to panic was exactly what
                        we needed in 2025.

                        <strong>Nominee:</strong> Tea Dating Advice Inc.
                    </p>
                    <p class="attribution">
                        <strong>Reported by:</strong> Simon Willison’s Weblog, ABC News.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The Incident:</strong> Tea, a dating safety app for women, suffered a "truly egregious data leak". This incident was caused by a "legacy unprotected Firebase cloud storage bucket". The core issue stemmed from code written prior to February 2024, which stored a dataset from before that date. During the app's early stages of development, "some legacy content was not migrated into their new fortified system" when they transitioned to a more robust and secure solution. Hackers were able to "break into the identifier link where data was stored before February 24, 2024".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The Impact:</strong> The breach resulted in unauthorized access to approximately 72,000 images. This included a highly sensitive subset of about 13,000 selfies and photo identifications (such as driving licenses) that users had submitted for account verification. Storing and then failing to secure these ID photos was deemed an "incredible breach of trust". Alarmingly, many of these ID photos also included EXIF location information, meaning "maps of Tea users are floating around the darker corners of the web now". Additionally, approximately 59,000 images that were publicly viewable in the app from posts, comments, and direct messages were accessed. It's worth noting that Tea had stopped requesting photo ID as an account requirement in 2023. Crucially, new users from February 2024 onwards were not affected by this cybersecurity incident, as their data was stored in the app's more robust and secure current system. According to a Tea spokesperson, no users' phone numbers or email addresses were accessed in the hack. Tea also engaged third-party cybersecurity experts to secure its systems.

                        <strong>Eligibility for an AI Darwin Award:</strong> While the Tea app data breach is a severe cybersecurity incident with widespread impact and clear ethical blind spots, it <strong>is not eligible for an AI Darwin Award</strong> based on the specific criteria for nomination.
                        <!-- <ul>
                            <li>**AI Involvement Required:** The AI Darwin Awards specifically honor "AI misadventure" and require a demonstrated involvement of "cutting-edge artificial intelligence" in the incident.</li>
                            <li>**No AI Involvement:** In this particular case, the sources explicitly state that **"vibe coding was not to blame"**. The issue was related to **"code written prior to February 2024, long before vibe coding was close to viable for building systems of this nature"**. Therefore, the breach was a consequence of a **legacy system's vulnerability and a failure in data migration**, rather than an AI agent or AI-driven system causing the catastrophic failure [13, Why They're Nominated in previous entry].</li>

            <p>
                Witnessed someone treat AI safety protocols like mere suggestions? Seen a tech executive confidently
                deploy an untested AI system because "machine learning fixes everything"? Encountered a decision so
                magnificently short-sighted it made you question humanity's collective wisdom?
