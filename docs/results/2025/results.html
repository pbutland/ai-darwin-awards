        <h1>2025 AI Darwin Award Results</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">A comprehensive analysis of this year's most spectacular AI failures</p>

        <section>
            <h2>The Verdict is In</h2>
            <p>After rigorous scientific analysis (and considerable amusement), the results are conclusive. From 17 eligible nominees, one stood triumphant in the grand tradition of spectacularly misplaced confidence in artificial intelligence.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Winner:</strong> <strong>Tesla Full Self-Driving</strong> with a commanding score of <strong>92.5</strong> points—proving once again that the combination of cutting-edge technology and stone-age decision-making remains humanity's most reliable source of entertainment.
            </blockquote>

            <p>The scoring methodology follows our rigorous scientific framework: <strong>Lethality</strong> (how dangerous), <strong>Hubris</strong> (how overconfident), <strong>Stupidity</strong> (how preventable), and <strong>Impact</strong> (how public the embarrassment). Each dimension is weighted according to its contribution to the overall spectacle of technological hubris meeting natural selection.</p>

            <h2>The Heat Map of Shame</h2>
            <p>Behold, the comprehensive thermal imaging of AI incompetence. Each cell represents the scoring intensity across our four critical dimensions. The deeper the color, the more spectacular the failure. Consider this a weather map for technological disasters.</p>
