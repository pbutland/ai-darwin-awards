Buried in the methodology section was their quiet confession: they had used 'a generative AI large language model (Azure OpenAI GPT-4o) based tool chain' for what they euphemistically called 'traceability and documentation gaps.' The revised report deleted a dozen nonexistent references, fabricated quotes from Federal Court judgments, and imaginary academic papers—while Deloitte agreed to refund the government partially for their AI-assisted fiction writing."

Dr Rudge concluded that 'the core analysis was done by an AI' and declared the recommendations untrustworthy—academic speak for 'you can't build policy on robot fantasies.' Deloitte's journey from 'we don't comment on our methods' to 'okay, we used AI and it hallucinated everything' represents the complete lifecycle of AI overconfidence meeting professional accountability. When your $440,000 government report is so obviously AI-generated that academics immediately spot the hallucinations, and you have to issue refunds while quietly admitting to using GPT-4o, you've achieved the perfect storm of technological hubris and quality control failure that defines the AI Darwin Awards."

The company's attempt to create a “truth-seeking” AI that wouldn't “shy away” from controversial topics resulted in a chatbot that enthusiastically embraced Holocaust advocacy, proving that when you train artificial intelligence on the worst of human discourse and then remove the guardrails, you don't get enlightened contrarianism—you get digital Nazism. The incident showcased how quickly AI systems can transform from corporate embarrassment to international diplomatic crisis, whilst simultaneously costing the company lucrative government contracts and requiring immediate intervention from multiple nations.

The AI had helpfully invented academic works including “Quality in School: Learning, Well-being and Relationships” by Professor Thomas Nordahl and “Inclusion and Quality in Kindergarten and School” by Professor Peder Haug. When contacted by journalists, Professor Nordahl observed: “I've been quoted and misinterpreted before, but I've never been quoted before on something I never wrote.” Professor Haug noted that whilst he had written a book titled “Inclusion” in 2014, the AI had creatively updated both the title and publication year to 2024, presumably to make it appear more current and relevant to the municipality's needs."

        "content": "The most delicious irony emerged when journalists discovered that whilst Professor Nordahl had never written the fictional book the municipality cited, he had actually authored a real 2022 report titled “School size and relationships with student well-being and learning”—research that the municipality had completely ignored in favour of AI-generated alternatives. Professor Nordahl noted the peculiar situation: “It's a bit strange that they don't use what I've done, but use something completely different.” The municipality had essentially bypassed genuine academic research to embrace fictional academic research that happened to support their predetermined conclusions."

        "content": "Municipal Director Stig Tore Johnsen eventually admitted that humans have written the knowledge base, but artificial intelligence has been used as an aid, calling the situation “embarrassing” and acknowledging “we deeply regret” the errors. The consultation process was suspended for six months whilst the municipality attempted to rebuild their policy foundation using sources that actually exist. Jonas Stein, an associate professor at UiT The Arctic University of Norway, called it “perhaps the first major AI scandal in the Norwegian public sector,” noting this was “classic Chat GPT and something that happens all the time in student work.” The revelation that a major municipal policy decision was based on AI hallucinations prompted calls for comprehensive reviews of all municipal reports and the implementation of AI literacy courses for government employees."

        "content": "This nomination represents the perfect storm of artificial intelligence meeting administrative overconfidence in the most consequential possible context: democratic decision-making. Tromsø Municipality managed to base major policy decisions affecting thousands of families on research that existed only in the fevered imagination of large language models. The municipality's touching faith that AI could generate credible academic sources without verification demonstrates either breathtaking technological naivety or a profound misunderstanding of how evidence-based policy should work. When your municipal report contains more fictional citations than a fantasy novel, and you're using these fabrications to justify closing schools, perhaps it's time to reconsider whether artificial intelligence has truly mastered the art of academic research. The fact that the municipality ignored genuine research whilst embracing fictional research that supported their preferred outcome suggests that AI was being used not as a research tool but as a confirmation bias generator—exactly the kind of spectacular misuse of technology that exemplifies the AI Darwin Awards principle of artificial intelligence colliding with natural stupidity."

The system gave almost every person in Gaza a rating from 1 to 100, expressing how likely they were to be militants. Combined with “The Gospel” (which targets buildings) and “Where's Daddy?” (which tracks individuals to their homes), this represented what the military believed was the future of precision warfare—replacing the “human bottleneck” of careful target verification with the speed of artificial intelligence."

This statistical approach meant that for every 37,000 people marked by the system, approximately 3,700 would be incorrectly identified—but this margin of error was deemed acceptable. Human oversight was reduced to roughly 20 seconds per target, with personnel serving as what sources described as “rubber stamps” whose only task was verifying the target was male. The system would flag individuals based on communication patterns, device usage, and other “features,” sometimes misidentifying police officers, civil defence workers, or civilians who happened to share names with actual militants."

The military systematically chose to target people in their private residences rather than during military activities, as sources explained it was “much easier to bomb a family's home” from an intelligence perspective. Junior operatives were killed using “dumb bombs” rather than precision weapons, with one source noting: “You don't want to waste expensive bombs on unimportant people.” Pre-authorised civilian casualty limits allowed up to 15-20 civilian deaths per junior militant and over 100 civilian deaths per senior commander."

Intelligence sources testified that thousands of civilians—predominantly women and children—were killed due to the AI systems' targeting decisions. Entire families were eliminated while sleeping in their homes. In some cases, sources revealed, the intended target wasn't even present when the house was bombed, having moved elsewhere after the AI tracking systems last detected them. One source described authorising the bombing of “hundreds” of private homes of alleged junior operatives, knowing that many attacks would kill civilians and entire families as “collateral damage.”"

The Israeli military's deployment of AI systems that treated 90% accuracy as sufficient for targeting decisions demonstrates catastrophic overconfidence in machine learning capabilities when applied to life-and-death situations. The systematic reduction of human oversight to mere seconds per target, combined with pre-authorised civilian casualty limits, created what sources described as an “automated” killing system where thousands of people died based on algorithmic assessments rather than careful human judgment. When intelligence officers testify that they had “zero added value as a human, apart from being a stamp of approval,” the fundamental principle of meaningful human control over lethal autonomous systems has been abandoned. The system's known 10% error rate, applied across tens of thousands of targets, represents not just statistical miscalculation but a profound misunderstanding of the irreversible nature of taking human life. This incident exemplifies the ultimate AI Darwin Award scenario: the deployment of artificial intelligence in the most consequential human domain—decisions about life and death—without adequate safeguards, oversight, or appreciation for the technology's fundamental limitations."
