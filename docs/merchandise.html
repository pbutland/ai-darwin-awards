            </p>
            <p>
                Our AI-powered merchandise development process is proceeding with all the careful planning and thorough testing that you've come to expect from the tech industry.

            <h2>Our Revolutionary AI-Powered Design Process</h2>
            <p>
                In keeping with the finest traditions of the AI industry, we've completely automated our merchandise design process using the latest in artificial intelligence technology. Our design AI has been trained on thousands of examples of poor decision-making, spectacular failures, and questionable fashion choices.
            </p>
            <p>
                The AI design system is currently undergoing extensive testing, which mostly involves us asking it to generate product descriptions and seeing if they make any sense. So far, the results have been... consistent with everything else we've documented on this website.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our AI has already proposed several innovative products, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A t-shirt that changes color based on how many AI safety protocols you've ignored today</li>
                <li>Smart mugs that refuse to hold coffee until you've completed mandatory AI ethics training</li>
                <li>Hoodies with built-in red flags that automatically deploy when someone mentions "moving fast"</li>
                <li>Socks that deliberately mismatch to represent the gap between AI promises and reality</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Quality Assurance</h2>
            <p>
                Rest assured, our merchandise quality control process follows the same rigorous standards used by our award nominees. We'll be testing our products using the tried-and-true method of "releasing them to the public and seeing what happens."
            </p>
            <p>
                Our AI quality assurance system has been trained on customer reviews from every tech product launch of the past five years, so it has a comprehensive understanding of what can go wrong when you skip proper testing. We're confident it will help us avoid all those mistakes while creating exciting new ones.
            </p>
            <div style="background: #f0f0f0; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0; border-radius: 5px; font-style: italic;">
                "Our AI quality assurance bot has already flagged several potential issues with our merchandise, including shirts that may spontaneously combust when worn near servers and mugs that might achieve sentience. We're treating these as features, not bugs."
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Pre-Order Notification</h2>
            <p>
                Want to be the first to know when our AI-designed merchandise becomes available? Of course you do! We're currently building an AI-powered notification system that will alert you the moment our products are ready for purchase.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our notification AI has been programmed with all the subtlety and restraint you'd expect from a system trained on marketing emails and social media algorithms. It promises to contact you at the perfect moment, using the optimal frequency, through the most appropriate channels.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, our notification system is still in beta testing after it attempted to notify our entire development team about lunch specials at 3 AM for six consecutive days. We're working on improving its understanding of "appropriate timing" and "human sleep schedules."
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>For now, check back here occasionally!</strong> We'll update this page as soon as our AI design system produces merchandise that exists in physical reality rather than just in its neural networks.
            </p>

            <h2>A Note on Delivery</h2>
            <p>
                We're pleased to announce that our shipping and logistics will be handled by our proprietary AI delivery optimization system. This advanced algorithm has been trained on the complete works of Murphy's Law and has shown remarkable creativity in finding new ways for packages to end up in the wrong place at the wrong time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Early testing suggests our AI shipping system has a particular talent for delivering merchandise to people who didn't order it, while sending confirmation emails to people whose orders it lost entirely. We consider this a feature that adds an element of surprise to the online shopping experience.
            </p>
            <p><small><em>Disclaimer: Delivery times are estimated by AI and may vary significantly from reality. Our AI shipping assistant once predicted a delivery time of "between now and the heat death of the universe," which we felt was refreshingly honest if not particularly helpful.</em></small></p>

            <h2>Help Us Design the Perfect AI Disaster Merchandise</h2>
            <p>
                Know a particularly quotable AI Darwin Award moment that would look great on a t-shirt? Have ideas for merchandise that celebrates the spectacular creativity humans show in misusing artificial intelligence? We want to hear from you!
            </p>
            <p>
                Submit your merchandise suggestions using the same form where you <a href="index.html#get-involved">nominate new AI Darwin Award candidates</a>. Just mark your submission as "merchandise idea" and our AI design system will incorporate your suggestions into its training data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember: the best AI Darwin Awards merchandise celebrates not just the failures, but the magnificent confidence with which those failures were achieved. We're looking for designs that capture the essence of saying "What's the worst that could happen?" while actively making it happen.
            </p>
            <p><small><em>*Timeline estimates provided by the same AI system that predicted ChatGPT would achieve general intelligence by lunch on Tuesday. Actual availability may vary from AI predictions, reality, and basic laws of physics.</em></small></p>
