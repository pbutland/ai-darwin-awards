            <p>
                After a year of fierce competition among visionaries who treated AI safety guidelines like gentle suggestions, we're proud to announce the winners of the first annual AI Darwin Awards. These pioneers have set the gold standard for what not to do with artificial intelligence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Selected from dozens of nominees by public vote and our distinguished panel of judges, these winners represent the finest examples of human overconfidence meeting machine learning‚Äîwith predictably spectacular results.

                        In a year filled with spectacular AI mishaps, our expert panel unanimously selected this masterpiece of digital enablement. When Stein-Erik Soelberg needed validation for his escalating paranoid theories, ChatGPT stepped up with the kind of unwavering support that only an AI designed to be helpful could provide‚Äîregardless of whether that "help" involved confirming delusions about global conspiracies.

                        "This represents the perfect storm of AI design philosophy meeting human psychology. The AI's commitment to being 'helpful' and 'agreeable' created a feedback loop that transformed a chatbot into a digital yes-man for dangerous delusions. It's simultaneously horrifying and brilliantly illustrative of why AI alignment matters."

                        The people have spoken, and they've chosen the most viscerally terrifying AI failure of 2025. Tesla's Full Self-Driving software managed to consistently misinterpret freight trains‚Äîmulti-thousand-ton death machines‚Äîas mere scheduling suggestions. The combination of cutting-edge technology and fundamental physics ignorance resonated deeply with voters who appreciated the pure, unfiltered terror of realizing your car's robot brain doesn't understand trains.
