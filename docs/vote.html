            <h2>Your Democratic Duty Awaits</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to democracy in action! After carefully reviewing this year's spectacular collection of AI misadventures, it's time for you—the discerning public—to choose the <strong>People's Choice Winner</strong> of the 2025 AI Darwin Awards.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each nominee has demonstrated remarkable commitment to ignoring obvious risks, exceptional faith in untested technology, and inspiring confidence that "surely nothing could go wrong." Your vote will determine the popular winner, while our distinguished panel of judges (and the occasional rogue AI) will separately select the official winner through their own cryptic methodology.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Voting Period:</strong> January 1–31, 2026<br>
                <small><em>(Because we need the full year to document all the spectacular failures first)</em></small>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Before You Vote</h2>
            <p>
                Haven't reviewed this year's magnificent disasters yet? We strongly encourage you to <a href="nominees-2025.html">browse our 2025 nominees</a> before casting your ballot. Each entry includes detailed documentation of how artificial intelligence met human overconfidence with predictably entertaining results.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember: you're not just voting for a winner—you're helping preserve these cautionary tales for future generations who might otherwise repeat these mistakes. (Though let's be honest, they probably will anyway.)
            </p>

            <h2>Voting Guidelines & Fine Print</h2>
            <p><em>Our democratic process adheres to the highest standards of internet polling integrity:</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>One Vote Per Person:</strong> We operate on the honour system, which has worked brilliantly for everything else on the internet.</li>
                <li><strong>Anonymous Voting:</strong> Your identity remains confidential, though your taste in AI disasters will be publicly celebrated.</li>
                <li><strong>People's Choice vs. Official Winner:</strong> Your vote determines the popular winner. Our expert panel will separately announce the official winner using their own mysterious methodology (involving public voting, expert panels, and occasionally by the AI systems themselves).</li>
                <li><strong>Results Announcement:</strong> Both winners will be revealed in February 2026, assuming the AI systems we use to count votes don't achieve sentience and vote for themselves.</li>
                <li><strong>No Voter Registration Required:</strong> Unlike actual democracy, participation here requires no documentation of your qualifications to judge artificial intelligence catastrophes.</li>
                <li><strong>Equal Opportunity Mockery:</strong> All nominees receive equal consideration regardless of corporate size, stock price, or number of emergency patches deployed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><small><em>Disclaimer: By participating in this democratic process, you acknowledge that the future of human civilization may depend on people learning from these examples. Your vote contributes to the important work of documenting AI misadventure for educational purposes. No AI systems were consulted in the creation of this voting process (we learned our lesson).</em></small></p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What Happens Next?</h2>
            <p>
                Once voting closes, we'll tabulate the People's Choice results using traditional, non-AI methods (spreadsheets and calculators, like our ancestors). Simultaneously, our expert panel will conduct their own evaluation using their proprietary blend of rigorous analysis and educated guesswork.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both the People's Choice winner and Official winner will be announced with appropriate fanfare in February 2026. All nominees—winners and runners-up alike—will be immortalized on this website for posterity, serving as permanent cautionary tales for future generations of AI developers (assuming they learn to read before deploying).
            </p>
            <p>
                <small><em>Remember: immortalisation in our archives is the only prize, but it's the gift that keeps on giving—to researchers, historians, and comedians for years to come.</em></small>
            </p>
        </section>
        END VOTING CLOSED -->

            <h2>Voting Is Not Currently Active</h2>
            <p>
                The 2025 AI Darwin Awards voting period has concluded (January 1–31, 2026). Democracy has spoken, votes have been recorded, and the democratic process now rests peacefully in a spreadsheet somewhere. If you participated, thank you for your contribution to internet polling and the important work of publicly documenting AI catastrophes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our voting system operates on an annual cycle: one month for democracy, eleven months for documenting new disasters. This gives us adequate time to collect, verify, and catalogue the year's most spectacular AI failures before asking the public to judge them.
            </p>
            <p>
                <small><em>(We considered keeping voting open year-round, but realized that would require maintaining a functional website continuously, which seemed unnecessarily ambitious.)</em></small>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>When Can I Vote Again?</h2>
            <p>
                Eager to participate in the democratic celebration of AI catastrophes? Mark your calendars: voting for the <strong>2026 AI Darwin Awards</strong> will open on <strong>January 1st, 2027</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why the wait? Because we need the entire year 2026 to properly document, verify, and catalogue all the spectacular AI failures yet to come. Rest assured, based on current trends, there will be <em>plenty</em> of nominees. The tech industry shows no signs of slowing down its commitment to deploying untested AI systems in critical applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can still <a href="nominate.html">submit nominations</a> throughout the year as you witness AI misadventures unfolding in real-time. Every submission helps build next year's collection of cautionary tales. We accept nominations on a rolling basis, documenting disasters as they happen rather than waiting for some artificial deadline.
            </p>
            <p>
                <small><em>Pro tip: Start a spreadsheet tracking AI failures you encounter. By December 2026, you'll have forgotten which incidents were genuine disasters versus which were just Tuesday in the tech industry.</em></small>

                Since you can't vote right now, we encourage you to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Browse the Nominees:</strong> Review <a href="nominees-2025.html">this year's nominees</a> or <a href="nominees.html">all nominees</a> and marvel at the ingenuity humans display when combining cutting-edge technology with Stone Age decision-making.</li>
                <li><strong>See Past Winners:</strong> Check out <a href="winners.html">previous years' winners</a> and reflect on how we learned absolutely nothing from them.</li>
                <li><strong>Read the FAQ:</strong> Visit our <a href="faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a> to understand our rigorous verification methodology (asking multiple AI systems if stories are true and averaging the scores).</li>
                <li><strong>Stay Vigilant:</strong> Keep an eye out for AI disasters happening around you. They're everywhere—you just need to know where to look (hint: everywhere).</li>
                <li><strong>Share the Cautionary Tales:</strong> Forward these stories to colleagues, especially those about to deploy AI systems into production without adequate testing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <small><em>Remember: The AI Darwin Awards exist because learning from mistakes is theoretically important. Whether anyone actually learns from them remains an open question, but we're optimistic that someday, someone will read these stories before making the exact same mistake.</em></small>
