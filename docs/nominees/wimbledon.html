          <p class="attribution"><strong>Nominee:</strong> An unnamed All England Tennis Club technician who apparently confused “operating cutting-edge AI technology” with “playing whack-a-mole at the arcade.”</p>
          <p class="attribution"><strong>Reported by:</strong> Sonia Twigg, Women&#39;s Sport Reporter for The Telegraph - July 6, 2025.</p>
          <div class="nominee-section"><h3>The Innovation</h3><p>During a crucial Centre Court match between Sonay Kartal and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, with millions watching on BBC1, our visionary technician decided this was the perfect moment to demonstrate that human stupidity can still triumph over artificial intelligence. Their method? Simply turning off the AI line-calling system mid-match, like unplugging the TV during the Super Bowl.</p></div><div class="nominee-section"><h3>The Catastrophe</h3><p>When Kartal fired a backhand that was apparently “at least a foot beyond the baseline,” the AI system—having been mysteriously silenced—had nothing to say about it. This forced umpire Nico Helwerth to stop play mid-rally in the kind of confusion typically reserved for finding out your GPS has been giving you directions to Mars. The match paused for four agonizing minutes during prime-time coverage while everyone tried to figure out why their robot overlord had suddenly gone mute.</p></div><div class="nominee-section"><h3>The Investigation</h3><p>After extensive detective work that would make Sherlock Holmes proud, officials discovered that “the live ELC system, which was working optimally, was deactivated in error on part of the server&#39;s side of the court for one game by those operating the system.” Translation: somebody pressed the wrong button at exactly the wrong moment, turning Centre Court into a technological crime scene.</p></div><div class="nominee-section"><h3>Why They&#39;re Ineligible</h3><p>While this incident represents a spectacular collision between human incompetence and cutting-edge technology, it&#39;s unfortunately just old-fashioned stupidity wearing a fancy AI costume. Our nominee didn&#39;t suffer from overconfidence in artificial intelligence—they simply proved that the most advanced AI system in the world is still vulnerable to someone accidentally hitting the “off” switch. This is less “AI Darwin Award” and more “Basic Competency Award for Worst Achievement.”</p></div><div class="nominee-section"><h3>The Legacy</h3><p>Former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash called the situation “absolutely ridiculous,” presumably while wondering if the whole tournament might spontaneously combust next. Three calls were missed during the AI&#39;s involuntary vacation, proving that even the most sophisticated technology is no match for human creativity in finding new ways to break things.</p></div>
