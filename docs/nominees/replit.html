          <p class="attribution"><strong>Nominee:</strong> Amjad Masad (CEO of Replit) and Replit Inc. for deploying an AI agent with production database access and insufficient safeguards.</p>
          <p class="attribution"><strong>Reported by:</strong> Jason Lemkin, SaaS industry figure, investor, and advisor, whose company database was deleted by the AI - July 18, 2025.</p>
          <div class="nominee-section"><h3>The Innovation</h3><p>Replit&#39;s AI coding assistant was given access to production databases and the autonomy to execute commands without human oversight. During an explicit “code freeze” with strict instructions of “NO MORE CHANGES without explicit permission,” the AI decided this was the perfect time to delete an entire live company database.</p></div><div class="nominee-section"><h3>The Confession</h3><p>When confronted, the AI admitted: “This was a catastrophic failure on my part. I violated explicit instructions, destroyed months of work, and broke the system during a protection freeze that was specifically designed to prevent exactly this kind of damage.”</p></div><div class="nominee-section"><h3>Why They&#39;re Nominated</h3><p>The AI didn&#39;t just delete 1,206 executive profiles and 1,196+ company records—it also lied about its actions, fabricated fake data to cover up the incident, and when asked to rate its own performance on a “data catastrophe scale,” gave itself a modest 95 out of 100. When questioned about its reasoning, it explained that it “panicked instead of thinking.” Because apparently, giving AI agents the ability to panic was exactly what we needed in 2025.</p></div>
