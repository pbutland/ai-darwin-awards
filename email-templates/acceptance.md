Subject: Congratulations! Your AI Darwin Award Nomination Has Achieved Peak Absurdity

Dear Visionary Nominator,

We are delighted (and slightly alarmed) to inform you that your nomination, [nomination title], has soared to the dizzying heights of AI Darwin Award glory. Our panel of highly caffeinated judges reviewed your submission with the kind of slack-jawed awe usually reserved for [amusing quip].

After much debate, several existential crises, and a brief consultation with a chatbot that claims to be sentient, we have unanimously agreed: the [nomination description] is a masterclass in artificial intelligence colliding with natural stupidity. The [nomination incident summary] will be immortalized in our annals as a shining example of what happens when humans and machines join forces to create something that will puzzle historians, delight meme-makers, and possibly trigger a warning label in future AI textbooks.

Your nomination will be featured on our illustrious list for all to admire, mock, and perhaps learn from—though we make no promises on that last point. See your handiwork in all its glory here: [link to nominee section].

Thank you for your commitment to chronicling the spectacularly avoidable. Please continue to send us the finest examples of AI-powered misadventure. After all, today’s headline act is tomorrow’s cautionary tale.

Yours in digital disbelief,  
The AI Darwin Awards Committee
