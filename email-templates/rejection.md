Subject: Your AI Darwin Award Nomination: A Stirring Cup of... [amusing quip]

Dear Visionary Nominator,

Thank you for submitting the [nomination title] for the prestigious AI Darwin Awards. We read your nomination with the same wide-eyed disbelief usually reserved for [amusing quip].

Alas, while the [nomination description] was a truly egregious feat of digital misadventure, our panel of highly caffeinated judges must regretfully inform you that it does not meet the strict (and, let’s be honest, slightly arbitrary) criteria for AI Darwin Award eligibility. As much as we love a good [nomination incident summary], the absence of actual AI involvement means this one falls into the “classic human error” category—a timeless genre, but not quite what we’re brewing for this year’s awards.

But don’t lose hope! In the grand tradition of AI, we reserve the right to change our minds, rewrite the rules, and let algorithms decide everything at the last minute. All nominations—eligible, ineligible, or just plain confusing—will be reconsidered when it’s time to crown the ultimate champion of artificial intelligence combined with natural stupidity.  In light of that, the nomination has still been added to our illustrious list for all to see: [link to nominee section].

Thank you for your vigilance and your willingness to shine a light on the spectacularly avoidable. Please keep those nominations coming. After all, today’s “not quite AI” disaster could be tomorrow’s headline act.

Yours in digital disbelief,  
The AI Darwin Awards Committee
